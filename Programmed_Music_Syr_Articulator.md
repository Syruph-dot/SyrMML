# A Neater format of current PMD MML programming, in assistance for MML-based composition
Currently Windows-oriented

# Fixes
 - Fucking R 01234??? --Annoying R auto numbering.
 - Complete Macro->unfolding Idea? Or redundant? —— Our Syrmml do not check grammar, only compiles. Such as: !Macro  @1o is OK.
 - Functionize? Since currently is only a parameterized with only one param at the only end.

 - Automatic Explicit Resets

# Ideas
 - Also allow #include, but relative path.
 - At drum, Dividing rhythm and drum type. 
 - More convenient voice tagging.
 - Force-Synchronization tags between channels, with master and slave mode. Need and Only one channel determine this tag's master mode. (for slaves, r when slave-triggered but yet not master, and skip to the tag when master triggered but yet not slave.)
 - // for comments, ; for separating lines, like C Programming.

 - Dynamic Assignment of ABCDEFGH?

# UI-based or VSCode extension Ideas
 - For one bar (separated by space) calculate its length (reciprocal_sum) and the note remaining to form a bar (fractional not float)
 - Frame a note (including its & proceeding, without the proceeding r) and highlight the note (the first one, without the ones for & lengthening)


# MIDI Decompile
 - Bar mode ? prevent 8+24=6
